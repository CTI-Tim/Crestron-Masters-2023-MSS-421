# Masters 2023 MSS-421 Class Files 

 The Library is released for the Masters 2023  C# for Crestron MSS-421 class Using CWS with C# for Crestron.   Assorted files for the class and to help the student are also included.    A compiled version of the library is included for ease of use by the students in class and initial run of the code for demonstration. 

 **IMPORTANT NOTE:** These are  very **<u>simplified</u>** classes in this library for students to use to learn concepts from.  They are not 100% complete in regards to error testing and error recovery. For example the TCP Helper needs to be expanded and modified to handle different string encodings based on the target data. It is left up to the students to complete the work and finish the C# code in the classes  on their own when they progress to that level.   Do not expect these to be ready to use in a production environment.  You are responsible for hardening and finishing all code for production. 

Also, there are documents included for the student for the class as well as the class Xpanel used for the exercises included in this repository.

Please take note how this example program  has both documentation, and comments in the code.   These things are considered a best practice both by CTI and the programming industry in general, and should be a part of every type of code you write and every single project you complete.  



There is a zip file that has html,css, and javascript that needs to be loaded as "configuration pages"  of the program running the example code.  this zip file is called htmlfiles.zip in the repository InitialFilesToUpload directory.
